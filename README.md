# About Me, Theo K. Valverde:

My name is Theo, and I've been living in Austin, Texas since 2014 although I originally grew up in southern Brazil.

I have a passion for the problem-solving aspect of software engineering, and that's what inspires me to delve deeper into the kinks we tend to run into when writing code in order to find thoughtful solutions that can be utilized in the pursuit of our goals.

Having graduated university from Texas State just a few weeks ago, I find myself eager to step into the tech industry and begin a new chapter in my career.

# Prior Experience:

I spent nearly five years working at Blizzard Entertainment as a resolutions specialist for tech and payment issues for their products, and while working there I was able to have an in-depth look at many different projects throughout the company which inspired me to begin learning how to code. My days then consisted of studying at Austin Community College in the morning and heading to work after classes, until around COVID when I decided to head into university full-time.

Having worked in a company that emphasized collaborative work for nearly five years at Blizzard Entertainment and then proceeding to design and write code in group projects at Texas State University for several different professors, I find that working with others is one of my strong-suits, and that I have also come to be able to learn from my peers in order to grow not only talent-wise but also as an indiviudal.
