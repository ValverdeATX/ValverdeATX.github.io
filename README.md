# About Me, Theo K. Valverde:

My name is Theo, and I've lived in Austin, Texas for over a decade although I originally hail from southern Brazil. I have a passion for the problem-solving aspect of software engineering, and it inspires me to delve deeper into the kinks we tend to run into when programming in the pursuit of finding thoughtful solutions my fellow programmers and I can utilize when reaching our goals.

Having graduated university from Texas State just a few weeks ago, I am eager to step into the industry and begin a new chapter.

# Skills of Note:

In the past few years I have developed the ability to write in C++, Python, Java.
I can also create MySQL Databases to run queries on, along with being able to work collaboratively and adhering to goals and schedules in JIRA.
Outside of programming, I am fluent in Portuguese and have an intermediate understanding of Spanish.
